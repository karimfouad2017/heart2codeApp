## Welcome

Thanks a lot for considering to contribute to OpenDialog. We are excited to have you join our ever-growing community.

We've put together the following guidelines to help you figure out where you can best be helpful and contribute to OpenDialog and its packages, which are hosted in the [OpenDialog Organisation on GitHub](https://github.com/opendialogai).

## 1. Code of conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [OpenDialog Code of Conduct](https://github.com/opendialogai/opendialog/blob/1.x/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report any unacceptable behaviour to community@opendialog.ai.

## 2. Our Community

Discussions about OpenDialog take place within our [Community Slack channel](https://opendialog.ai/support/). Anybody is welcome to join these conversations.

Wherever possible, do not take these conversations to private channels, including contacting the Project Maintainers directly. Keeping communication public means everybody can benefit and learn from the conversation.


## 3. Help us by spreading the word

You don't have to make any code changes to OpenDialog to become a Contributor. Help other people discover OpenDialog by sharing or creating content.

- Leave us a star on [GitHub](https://github.com/opendialogai/opendialog) and increase OpenDialog's visibility as an open-source framework
- Share and comment on content created by OpenDialog
- Write a blog post and share your learnings with the community
- Give a presentation and speak about your experience with OpenDialog with colleagues or a meet-up


## 4. Why not share your code?

You can have a huge impact on OpenDialog without ever touching the framework's core.

- Open source a project and help others learn OpenDialog by showing your code
- Build a plugin and help others extend OpenDialog easily


## 5. Fix or raise an issue

We know that adding to OpenDialog's core can be daunting for beginners but here are some ideas to get you started.

- Investigate our [Github issues](https://github.com/opendialogai/opendialog/issues) and find out what people are currently discussing.
- Resolve an issue that has already been reported and is not in progress
- Found a new issue? Raise an issue report but check that it doesn't already exist before raising it. 
	- Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behaviour that is not occurring. 

**Working on your first Pull Request?** You can learn how from this free series - [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://app.egghead.io/playlists/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github)


## 6. Add a new feature

Do you have an idea for a new feature?

- Search through the GitHub issues and the community Slack to see whether someone else has raised a similar idea or question.
	-If not, suggest your change in the open-source Slack channel and start writing code.
- Please do not open an issue on GitHub until you have collected positive feedback about the change. GitHub issues are primarily intended for bug reports and fixes.
	- If positive feedback is received an OpenDialog Project Maintainer will add a new feature or issue, if it does not already exist.

We hope to see and hear from you however you decide to get involved and contribute to the OpenDialog project. We're excited to have you part of our journey towards making a tool that enables teams to design, develop, deploy, test, maintain and refine conversational applications.
